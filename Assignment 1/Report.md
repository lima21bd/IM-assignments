## Comparison Between Five Time Complexities

### What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

Graph for the following equations are shown below:

Logarithmic = θ(log n)

Linear = θ(n)

Quadratic = θ(n²)

Cubic = θ(n³)

Polynomial = θ(n^k)
