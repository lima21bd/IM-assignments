## Comparison Between Five Time Complexities

### What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

Graph for the following time complexities are shown below:

Logarithmic = θ(log n)

Linear = θ(n)

Quadratic = θ(n²)

Cubic = θ(n³)

Polynomial = θ(n^k)

In the above graph, 
Axis - X = Number of input sizes, 
Axis - Y = Computational cost. 

The more computation cost increases, the higher it takes time to solve the problem.
The graph shows the lowest computation cost among those 5 is θ(logn). So, I can say among five time complexities θ(logn) will be the best solution. Because it is clearly visible that the increasing nature of x value does not increases that much computatinal cost for θ(log n).
